# Markowitzify

(C) 2020 Mark M. Bailey, PhD

## About

Markowitzify will implement a variety of portfolio and stock/cryptocurrency analysis methods to optimize portfolios or trading strategies.  The two primary classes are portfolio and stonks.<br>

The portfolio class will implement portfolio optimization based on the theory described by Harry Markowitz (University of California, San Diego), and elaborated by Marcos M. Lopez de Prado (Cornell University).  In 1952, Harry Markowitz posited that the investment problem can be represented as a convex optimization algorithm.  Markowitz's Critial Line Algorithm (CLA) estimates an "efficient frontier" of portfolios that maximize an expected return based on portfolio risk, where risk is measured as the standard deviation of the returns.  However, solutions to these problems are often mathematically unstable.  Lopez de Prado developed a machine-learning solution called Nested Cluster Optimization (NCO) that addresses this instability.  This repository applies both the CLA algorithm, as well as the improved NCO algorithm, to a stock portfolio.  Additionally, this repository simulates portfolio performance over time using Monte Carlo methods, and calculates various other measures of portfolio performance, including the Hurst Exponent and Sharpe Ratio.<br>

The stonks class will create a stock or cryptocurrency object containing OHLC data.  The Relative Strength Indicator (RSI), a Fractal Indicator (as defined by Kaabar), Bollinger Bands, and Bullish/Bearish signals (based on RSI and the Fractal Indicator) can be calculated.  Simulated trading strategies can also be backtested to elucidate an optimal strategy based on maximized profit.

### Simulate Trading Strategies
Simulates and backtests a set of strategies (Buy/Risk coefficients) to find the optimum trading strategy that maximizes profit within a range of "Buy" and "Risk" values. Uses exponential average true range to quantify risk.  "Buy" and "Risk" parameters are multiples of eATR for entry and exit criteria, respectively.  For example, if buy = 1, then the entry criterion is defined as 1x eATR plus the previous day's closing price.  If risk = 2, then a stop loss of 2x the eATR is defined as the exit criterion.<br>
